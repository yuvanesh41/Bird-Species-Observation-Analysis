# Bird-Species-Observation-Analysis

Project Overview:-

This project aims to analyze the distribution and diversity of bird species across two distinct ecosystems: forests and grasslands. By examining bird species observations, the goal is to understand how environmental factors—such as vegetation type, climate, and terrain—influence bird populations and their behavior.

The study involves working with observational data of bird species present in both ecosystems, identifying patterns of habitat preference, and assessing the impact of these habitats on bird diversity. The findings from this analysis can provide valuable insights into habitat conservation, biodiversity management, and the effects of environmental changes on avian communities.

Key Tasks:-

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:Used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to clean and preprocess the observational bird species data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Performed comprehensive EDA using VS Code to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. Data Visualization:Created interactive and insightful visualizations using Power BI to represent bird distribution, habitat preferences, and biodiversity indices. Presentation of Findings:Compiled the findings from EDA and visualizations into a PowerPoint presentation, highlighting key insights and recommendations for habitat conservation and biodiversity management.

Tools & Technologies:-

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Python (for data cleaning and EDA) Power BI (for data visualization) PowerPoint (for presenting findings)

Outcomes:-

Identified patterns of bird habitat preference between forests and grasslands. Assessed the impact of environmental factors on bird diversity. Provided actionable insights to support environmental conservation and biodiversity efforts.
